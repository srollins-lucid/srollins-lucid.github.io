                      <li>A final step in the development process</li>
                      <li>
                        Have your code looked over and tested by your peers

                      <li>Code quality matters!</li>
                      <li>Fresh, unbiased eyes can find errors and opportunities for improvement</li>
                      <li>
                        Software is complicated
                        <ul><li>Even expert code authors have an incomplete picture of the system in their minds</li></ul>

                      There are many potential pitfalls to be aware of, and it's easy to forget them when we're in the middle of coding.<br>

commit ca1f8488d2393460f3b96b02c6301c74a5cfd445
Author: Dan Mercer &lt;dmercer@lucidchart.com&gt;

    CHART-33957 - One-line fix for google slides auth flow.
    
    The ConversionClient was wrapping the XHR error in an Error, meaning the caller
    could no longer check the status code of the HTTP response
    (googleslidesdialog.ts line 344).
    
    This bug was introduced in 65928ff4695cfae567b1e702a354ff985a17df5f.</code></pre>

                      Stash lets you review commit by commit.
                      <br />
                      Commits are cheap! Create a lot of them. Not only will your code reviewers be grateful, but the git history will be easier to manage as well.
                      <br />
                      Will be brought up later, but make sure every commit builds on its own. If you ever do a git bisect, you'll thank me.

                    <h3>How to Identify a Modular Commit</h3>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Commits limited to one major change and other essential changes that stem from it</li>
                      <li>Commits that touch a file for 1-2 reasons</li>
                      <li>Primary PR efforts are preceeded by refactoring commits that enable the main feature</li>
                      <li>Avoid "Formatting," "Make it compile," or "PR Fixes"</li>
                      <li>
                        Where possible:
                        <ul>
                          <li>Ensure every commit compiles on its own</li>
                          <li>Run the formatter before committing</li>
                          <li>Bundle unit tests into same commit as feature work</li>
                        </ul>
                      </li>

                    <ul>
                      <li>Before starting a project, review existing code to identify possible strategy for breaking up commits</li>
                      <li>When opportunities for small deviations or refactors come up during development, <span class="code-highlight">git stash</span> existing work first</li>
                      <li>Review code when feature nears completion to identify isolated changes and commit separately using <span class="code-highlight">git add -p</span></li>
                      <li>Patch committed but unmerged code changes with <br><span class="code-highlight">git commit --amend</span>, or <span class="code-highlight">git add -p</span> and <span class="code-highlight">git rebase -i</span></li>
                    </ul>
                    <aside class="notes">
                      Talk to your local git expert (likely team lead; alternatively #git or #dev)<br>
                      We do not naturally work in a "modular commit" way; you have to train yourself to notice where the natural breaks are and how to pull apart changes in a sensible manner<br>

                        Small in terms of:

                      Keyword Owners are automatically added to pull requests that add/delete/change code involving your keyword

                      Responsible Code Owner behavior:
                      <ul>
                        <li>If you don't review it all, leave a comment explaining what you did review</li>
                        <li>Consider leaving a Task stating a full review is still required</li>
                      </ul>

                    <li>Leave Tasks on the pull request for the most important feedback</li>
                    <li>Prioritize code improvements over code perfection</li>
                    <li>Leave helpful feedback in addition to pointing out bugs</li>
                    <li>Ask questions; encourage discussion and thoughtful analysis</li>
                    <li>Approach code reviews with a focused mentality</li>
                    <li>Don’t rush your reviews</li>

                  <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
                  <ul>
                    <p>Code reviews are about quality, not finding fault. The point of software code review is to eliminate as many defects as possible, regardless of who "caused" the error.</p>
                    <p>As code reviews expose developers to new ideas and technologies, they write better and better code.</p>
                    <p>When done right, code reviews actually save time in the long run.</p>
                  </ul>
