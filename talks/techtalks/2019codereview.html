    CHART-33957 - One-line fix for google slides auth flow.
    
    The ConversionClient was wrapping the XHR error in an Error, meaning the caller
    could no longer check the status code of the HTTP response
    (googleslidesdialog.ts line 344).
    
    This bug was introduced in 65928ff4695cfae567b1e702a354ff985a17df5f.</code></pre>

                      Stash lets you review commit by commit.
                      <br />
                      Commits are cheap! Create a lot of them. Not only will your code reviewers be grateful, but the git history will be easier to manage as well.
                      <br />
                      Will be brought up later, but make sure every commit builds on its own. If you ever do a git bisect, you'll thank me.

                      <li>Commits with one major change and other essential changes that stem from it</li>

                      <li>Primary PR efforts are preceeded by refactoring commits that enable the main feature</li>
                      <li>Avoid "Formatting," "Make it compile," or "PR Fixes" commits</li>
                      <li>
                        Where possible:
                        <ul>
                          <li>Ensure every commit compiles on its own</li>
                          <li>Run the formatter before committing</li>
                          <li>Bundle unit tests with feature work</li>

                    <ul>
                      <li>Before starting a project, review existing code to identify possible strategy for breaking up commits</li>
                      <li>When opportunities for small deviations or refactors come up during development, <span class="code-highlight">git stash</span> existing work first</li>

                      <br />
                      Added benefit: continuously depoly incremental, bite-sized changes

                      More effort for code writer, but stories will spend less time in code review and bugs will be caught more quickly.

                  <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
                  <ul>
                    <p>Code reviews are about quality, not finding fault. The point of software code review is to eliminate as many defects as possible, regardless of who "caused" the error.</p>
                    <p>As code reviews expose developers to new ideas and technologies, they write better and better code.</p>
                    <p>When done right, code reviews actually save time in the long run.</p>
                  </ul>
